Because of road closings from hurricane flooding damage on the Blue Ridge Parkway, please contact Alpine Village Resort's Office to see if the Blue Ridge Parkway is accessible before attempting to drive to Alpine from Asheville via this particular route. From Asheville, it is about the same distance whether you travel east on I-40 to Old Fort and take the US70 exit towards NC 80 leading to Alpine Village (the twisty, climby route), or if you travel north from Asheville on US 19/23, then 19E east through Burnsville then NC 80 south at Micaville towards Alpine Village (a much gentler route).

If you are traveling from Tennessee, take US23 southwest out of Johnson City going towards Asheville. After crossing the Tennessee/NC state line you should turn at the inter-section with 19E going towards Burnsville. Again, just east of Burnsville you can pick up NC 80 at Micaville going south towards Alpine Village. We do not recommend taking the Blue Ridge Parkway during rain or low-hanging clouds as the area passing Mt. Mitchell can get fogged in and treacherous.

This will take you to the San Ysidro, California border crossing (at Tijuana). There will be various freeway exit signs along the way including one reading ""Last U.S. Exit."" If you are planning to walk across the border, then you'll leave the freeway at this exit, find a parking lot, and proceed to enter Mexico (Tijuana) on foot. If you continue driving, the Interstate the freeway takes you right into Mexico. There are two roads that will bring you to Rosarito Beach. The toll road (cuota) and the free (libre) road. The well maintained toll road is faster and easier with beautiful ocean views. The toll highway is also patrolled by the ""Green Angels,"" a mobile mechanic that will assist you in the event you have mechanical problems. There are solar powered call boxes located about every two miles along the toll road. If you need help just pick up the phone and a bilingual operator will provide assistance. The free road is harder to find if you are not familiar with Tijuana, Once you locate it, you will find a modern four-lane highway, but with heavy commercial traffic, many exits, and many people. Not nearly as scenic as the toll route. Our recommendation is to take the toll road. To get to the toll road from the border, bear to the right just after entering Mexico. As the road begins to split, take the second left where the signs read ""Ensenada Cuota via Calle Poniente."" That will take you to the road that runs along the international border (Avenida Internacional). You'll see the border fence to your right as you travel west. You'll stay on this road as you climb the first hill. Stay right and keep going straight. As you drop down into the canyon (known as ""Smugglers Canyon""), you'll want to take the right turn-off to the road going west. Up another hill and then you'll drop down to Playas de Tijuana intersection. Since we are going to the Rosarito Beach Hotel we'll follow the road as it curves left. Just ahead is the toll booth. A toll fee of $2.20 US dollars will take you all the way to Rosarito Beach. The 17 mile scenic trip will take about fifteen minutes. It is a beautiful trip. Some of northern Baja California's most spectacular scenery is along this route that glides along the coast with its unblemished views of the Pacific Ocean. You'll pass a number of real estate developments as well, a testimony to Baja California as a highly desirable location for a vacation or retirement home. At Rosarito Beach, there are four exits off the toll road. The first exit will take your right into town. You'll drive along Benito Juarez Boulevard (main street) for about two miles to the Rosarito Beach Hotel, instantly recognizable by the white arches at the hotels entrance. If you would prefer to avoid city traffic, stay on the toll road and take the fourth and last exit which has an arch identifying the town. This exit takes you directly to the Rosarito Beach Hotel (two short blocks).",

Wenela Tidal Pool, two kilometers south, is a fascinating natural treasure, having a natural tunnel and blow hole linking the pool to the sea. The whole of Mozambique is a malaria area and recommended prophylaxis should be taken. Your doctor can advise you on the best type for the area of travel and your personal requirements. However, taking prophylaxis will not guarantee that you will not contract malaria! The best way to avoid malaria is to avoid being bitten by the mosquitoes that carry the parasite. Only the females of one species of mosquito carry the tiny parasite, and the greatest incidence of malaria is in areas of high population where there are many people for the mosquito to bite and pass the parasite between. Mosquitoes usually bite between sunset and sunrise, so make sure that you are covered up during this time! Wear loose fitting, long sleeved shirts and trousers, use a good insect repellent and sleep underneath a mosquito net or in a tent/ room sealed with netting. If you do develop flu-like symptoms, or feel at all unwell, during your holiday or after your return home, you must make sure that your doctor knows that you have recently travelled in a malaria area. Malaria is not a serious problem provided people take adequate precautions and seek advice and treatment immediately if they feel unwell. Maputo's private hospitals are of a good standard with clean and safe facilities. However, serious medical cases will be evacuated by air to South Africa where further facilities are available. For this reason you must make sure that comprehensive travel insurance is taken out before you travel, this insurance should cover any medical expenses, air evacuation and repatriation if necessary.
